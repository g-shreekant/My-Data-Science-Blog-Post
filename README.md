## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project. I chose FIFA 19 dataset to answer the following questions:

1.Who are the Top 10 most Valuable Players?  
2.Which are Top 10 Clubs having most Valuable Players?  
3.Who are the Top 10 Highly Paid Players?  
4.Which are Top 10 Clubs having most Highly Paid Players?  
5.Are the higher valued players always paid more, i.e, what is the correlation between value and wage 


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

fifa19.csv contains lastest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including age, potential, wage. There are a lot of other interesting attributes for the players as well such as release clause.

There is also a notebook available here to show my work related to the above questions. I have also uploaded the html file for the same.
